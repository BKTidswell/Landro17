# Landro17
code for landro summer 2017

To run this code you will need to get some python libraries.
I plan to trim down 2017GenomeFull but right now at least it needs a lot of them

random, os, and math should already be there

I used pip to install all of these, which works pretty well
You need to get:
	pygame
	numpy
	plotly
	igraph
	networkx

I am also using python version 2.7

Hopefully this all works and you can run the code.

If not find me I guess?
